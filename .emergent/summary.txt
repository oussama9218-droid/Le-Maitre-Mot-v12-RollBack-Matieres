The previous AI engineer successfully brought Le Maître Mot V1 from conception to a functional MVP. The work focused on implementing core features like AI-powered exercise generation (initially GPT-5, then GPT-4o), PDF export (initially WeasyPrint, later attempting ReportLab, then unifying back to WeasyPrint with HTML templates), and a freemium model with Stripe monetization. Significant effort was dedicated to robust magic link authentication via Brevo, addressing critical security flaws such as multi-device session management and token invalidation. Key issues involved resolving timezone errors, fixing frontend/backend desynchronization regarding Pro status, and a prolonged debugging process for PDF template customization, culminating in a refactor to standardize on WeasyPrint using new HTML templates. The current state reflects a stable authentication system and an ongoing transition to a unified PDF generation pipeline.

<product_requirements>
The objective is to create Le Maître Mot, an application enabling French teachers to generate high-quality educational materials efficiently. Key features include generating exercise sheets aligned by subject/level/chapter, offering modular templates, easily differentiating versions (A/B, difficulty), and exporting as PDF/DOCX. The UI must be intuitive for non-tech-savvy users.

Current implementation provides AI-powered generation (Maths, 6e-3e, French curriculum) with solutions, using GPT-4o. PDF export of subject and solution is available. A freemium model offers 3 free exports; Pro mode (paid via Stripe) grants unlimited exports. Authentication is via magic link (Brevo), recognizing and persisting Pro status. The application was rebranded from LessonSmith to Le Maître Mot. Recent work includes implementing multi-device login, single-session enforcement, subscription duplicate checks, and personalized PDF templates.

</code_architecture>

<pending_tasks>
- Add templates for personalized documents (logo, header, footer) - *Partially completed, but the overall system needs to be fully verified.*
- Extend exercise generation to other subjects: French and Physics-Chemistry (collège, 6e→3e).
- Implement advanced PDF layout options.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was working on a critical issue where personalized PDF templates were not being applied, despite several attempts to implement a ReportLab-based solution. The core problem was identified as a reliance on two PDF generation libraries (WeasyPrint and ReportLab), with the ReportLab implementation being complex and fragile, leading to unintended fallbacks to the old generic design.

The user explicitly requested to **unify PDF generation by using only WeasyPrint**, creating new HTML templates (, ) with placeholders for Pro user customization.

The AI engineer has:
1.  **Created new HTML templates**:  and  with necessary placeholders.
2.  **Refactored **: The  function has been significantly modified to exclusively use WeasyPrint. It now dynamically selects the appropriate HTML template (Pro or standard) and populates it with user-specific data before generating the PDF.
3.  **Removed ReportLab code**: All redundant ReportLab-specific imports, functions, and logic have been removed from  to streamline the PDF generation process.

The last action recorded was the AI engineer initiating a backend restart after cleaning up the remaining ReportLab code, confirming the unification to WeasyPrint.

<optional_next_step>
Verify the backend starts correctly after ReportLab removal, then perform comprehensive tests of the unified WeasyPrint PDF generation.
