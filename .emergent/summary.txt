The AI engineer's work on Le Maître Mot V1 commenced with an MVP, providing AI-powered exercise generation, PDF export, freemium access, and magic link authentication. The trajectory highlights two phases: stability verification and functionality expansion. Initial bugs included logo rendering in PDFs and Pro status synchronization, which were addressed by refining session management and WeasyPrint path handling.

Subsequent development focused on adding multiple PDF export styles (Classique, Moderne, Élève, Minimal, Corrigé détaillé, Académique) with dynamic access control. A significant effort was dedicated to LaTeX formula rendering, evolving from a problematic client-side MathJax approach to a robust server-side SVG conversion using  and . Most recently, the engineer integrated geometric schema generation (triangles, squares, circles) into the AI generation and backend rendering, converting JSON schema definitions into SVG images. The immediate challenge is ensuring these geometric schemas are correctly parsed and rendered as Base64 for web display and integrated into the PDF export pipeline to prevent raw JSON from appearing in the final document. The engineer is currently debugging the  function to properly integrate this schema rendering logic.

<product_requirements>
Le Maître Mot aims to be a comprehensive application for French teachers, enabling efficient creation of high-quality educational content. It should generate diverse exercise sheets by subject (Maths, French, Physics-Chemistry), level (6e-3e), and chapter, and provide customizable templates. Key features include AI-powered generation of exercises and solutions, differentiated versions (A/B, difficulty), and export to PDF/DOCX. The UI must be user-friendly.

Currently, the application supports AI-powered content generation using GPT-4o, solution generation, and PDF export for both exercise and solution sheets. A freemium model allows 3 free exports, with unlimited access via a paid Pro subscription managed by Stripe. Magic link authentication via Brevo ensures secure login, multi-device sessions, and Pro status persistence. Recent enhancements include single-session enforcement, subscription duplicate checks, and personalized Pro PDF templates (with logo, school, professor details, year, footer, and style selection). The application provides distinct PDF designs: a student-friendly version for non-Pro users and an ultra-professional, customizable version for Pro users. Latest updates include multiple export styles (Classique, Moderne, Élève, Corrigé détaillé, Minimal, Académique), high-quality server-side LaTeX rendering to SVG, and AI-generated geometric schemas (triangles, squares, circles) rendered as SVGs within documents for both web display and PDF export.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was addressing a critical issue where geometric schemas generated by the AI were not appearing correctly on the web interface *before* PDF export, but were working for PDF export. The user clarified that the logic for detecting and replacing the JSON schema with its rendered SVG/Base64 representation was missing or incorrect within the  (or  in the AI's current context) function.

The engineer had previously implemented:
1.  A  module to convert geometric JSON schemas into SVG.
2.  An update to the  endpoint in  to convert these schemas into Base64 encoded PNGs for web display.
3.  An update to the AI prompt to generate geometric schemas as JSON within exercise text.

The current work focuses on integrating the detection and replacement of geometric schema JSON within the  function in . The AI has confirmed that its  function correctly generates SVG for PDF. The immediate task is to ensure this function is properly invoked to parse the document's content (énoncé, solution, étapes) for geometric schema JSON, convert it, and embed the resulting SVG or Base64 image into the HTML template *before* WeasyPrint generates the PDF, thus ensuring consistency across web and PDF rendering.

<optional_next_step>
