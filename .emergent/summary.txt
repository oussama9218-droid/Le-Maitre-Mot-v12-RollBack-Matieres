The AI engineer successfully established Le Maître Mot V1 as a functional MVP. Initial work included AI-powered exercise generation (GPT-4o), PDF export (unified to WeasyPrint), freemium model (Stripe), and magic link authentication (Brevo) with robust session management. Key challenges involved timezone errors, Pro status desynchronization, and persistent PDF template customization issues.

The trajectory chronicles a journey through two main phases:
1.  **Stability Verification:** Confirmed system stability, backend operation, and unified WeasyPrint PDF generation after ReportLab removal.
2.  **Functionality Expansion:** Extended exercise generation to French and Physics-Chemistry, implemented advanced PDF layout options (margins, page format, visual styles), and integrated basic analytics.

Critical bug fixes included:
*   Resolving the white page PDF issue by correctly implementing Jinja2 loops for rendering exercises within HTML templates.
*   Fixing the  endpoint to correctly parse  sent by the frontend, ensuring Pro user customization data was saved to MongoDB.
*   Addressing template design degradation for non-Pro users by restoring a richer, student-friendly layout, and refining Pro templates for an ultra-professional look.
*   Refactoring template management by extracting HTML content from  into a dedicated  directory for improved maintainability.
*   Implementing logo upload support, including file saving and serving static files.
*   Investigating persistent logo display issues, leading to the discovery that WeasyPrint requires absolute  paths for local images.

The immediate work is diagnosing why the Pro user's logo and personalized data still don't appear in the PDF, despite fixes for upload and pathing. The investigation is currently focusing on session authentication and Pro status detection during the PDF export process.

<product_requirements>
The goal is to develop Le Maître Mot, an application for French teachers to efficiently create high-quality educational content. It should generate diverse exercise sheets (by subject, level, chapter), offer customizable templates, support differentiated versions (A/B, difficulty), and export to PDF/DOCX. The UI must be user-friendly.

Current features: AI-powered generation (Maths, French, Physics-Chemistry for 6e-3e levels using GPT-4o), solution generation, and PDF export for both exercise and solution sheets. A freemium model allows 3 free exports, with unlimited access via a paid Pro subscription (Stripe). Magic link authentication (Brevo) manages secure login, multi-device sessions, and Pro status persistence. Recent work focused on single-session enforcement, subscription duplicate checks, personalized Pro PDF templates (including logo, school, professor details, year, footer, and style selection), and basic usage analytics. The application provides two distinct PDF designs: a student-friendly version for non-Pro users and an ultra-professional, customizable version for Pro users.

</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application uses a standard full-stack architecture with a React frontend, FastAPI backend, and MongoDB database.



-   **/app/backend/server.py**:
    -   **Importance**: Core FastAPI backend. Handles API logic, MongoDB interactions, LLM calls, PDF generation, authentication, and Stripe payments.
    -   **Changes Made**:
        -   Refactored PDF generation to exclusively use WeasyPrint with Jinja2 loops for content.
        -   Expanded  to include Français and Physique-Chimie subjects, updating AI generation prompts.
        -   Added Pydantic models (, , ) and corresponding API routes (, ).
        -   Modified  to accept  for customization data and  for logo.
        -   Implemented logic to save uploaded logos to  and store their paths.
        -   Added  to serve static files from .
        -   Modified PDF rendering context to pass logo and other personalization data directly to templates.
        -   Implemented conversion of relative logo URLs to absolute  paths for WeasyPrint.
        -   Created  helper function for reading templates from files.
-   **/app/backend/templates/**:
    -   **Importance**: New directory for all HTML templates used by WeasyPrint for PDF generation. Separates design from backend logic.
    -   **Changes Made**: Contains , , , . All templates were extensively modified: standard ones reverted to an élève-friendly design, and Pro ones updated to an ultra-professional and customizable design.
-   **/app/frontend/src/App.js**:
    -   **Importance**: Main React component, manages UI, state, and API calls.
    -   **Changes Made**: Integrated authentication states (, , ). Contains  to handle session tokens.
-   **/app/frontend/src/components/TemplateSettings.js**:
    -   **Importance**: Frontend component for Pro user template customization.
    -   **Changes Made**: Handles inputs for professor, school, year, footer, logo upload, and style selection. Sends data as  to the backend.

<pending_tasks>
- Investigate why the Pro user's logo and personalized data are not displaying in generated PDFs, specifically focusing on the user's Pro status detection and session token usage during the export process.
- Implement automated tests for new features as requested by the user.
- Implement advanced PDF layout options (beyond basic settings now added).
- Integrate comprehensive analytics (beyond the basic tracking endpoint implemented).

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was deep-diving into a bug where a Pro user's logo and personalized information (school name, professor name, etc.) were not appearing in the generated PDF, despite the user having uploaded a logo and saved their preferences, and despite the database containing the logo URL.

The engineer performed a multi-step diagnostic:
1.  **DB Check for **: Confirmed  had a template entry, and the  and  were correctly stored in the database.
2.  **File System Check**: Verified the logo file physically existed in .
3.  **URL Accessibility Check**: Confirmed the logo was accessible via its served URL, indicating the static file server was operational.
4.  **WeasyPrint Path Conversion**: Implemented a critical fix to convert relative logo URLs (e.g., ) to absolute  paths (e.g., ) because WeasyPrint requires absolute paths for local image rendering.
5.  **Pro Status Discrepancy**: The most recent finding indicates that while the  collection shows the user has a logo, and the  collection shows  as an active Pro subscriber, the  collection might not reflect this  status (). More critically, recent PDF exports were tagged , and the  function appears to treat the user as a guest, implying an issue with session authentication or Pro status retrieval during the export request itself.

The  function correctly queries , but the problem likely lies in how the  endpoint receives and processes the user's session token to determine their Pro status for rendering.

<optional_next_step>
Investigate the  function's session token validation to ensure the user's Pro status is correctly identified.
